# React-Lottery-Game
Excited to share my latest project built with React: the Lottery Game! This web application allows users to simulate lottery draws with random number generation. I implemented key React concepts like components, props, events, and state to manage user interactions and data flow. A great experience in building dynamic interfaces!
